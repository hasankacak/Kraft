There are 4 access modifier in java
       - public
       - default
       - protected
       - private

       *Variables-Constructor-methods

       **public**
       The access level is everywhere
       What does it mean everywhere?
            - current class-outside the current class within package- outsize package

       **default**
       The access level is only within package
       if we do not type any access modifier, it will be default

       **protected**
       if there is not any relation between classes, protected access modifier is like default
       But there is parent-child relation between classes,
       child class can reach parent class, even if it is outside the package (for data member and methods)

       **private**
       The access level is only within the class.
       It can not reach from outside the class.

       **private constructor role**
       you can not create the instance out of class

       **method overloading**
       not be mre restrictive  overriding method in child class

       **local variables**
       do not have access modifier
